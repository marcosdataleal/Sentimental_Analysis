# Sentimental Analysis

## Project Description - Customer Review Sentiment Analysis (Fast Food Industry)

This project, developed in Jupyter Notebook, focuses on performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews from various fast food companies. The workflow includes a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to prepare the data for analysis. After collecting and cleaning the data, I applied several transformations to structure the dataset effectively using pandas.

To analyze and visualize customer sentiments, I integrated multiple Python libraries such as NLTK for natural language processing, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and pandas for data manipulation. The project includes:

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
- Modification and enhancement of DataFrames for analysis
- Generation of visual insights through bar charts, word clouds, and sentiment distribution plots

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer opinions, highlighting areas of satisfaction and potential improvement across different fast food chains.
